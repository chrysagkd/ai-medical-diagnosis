# AI Medical Diagnosis: AI for Medical Prediction üöëü§ñ

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of AI-powered projects aimed at transforming medical diagnostics. By utilizing advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, these projects help analyze, segment, and predict medical data, specifically focusing on MRI scans.

## üöÄ What's Inside?

This repository includes five projects designed to demonstrate how AI can revolutionize the medical field:

### 1. **Image Segmentation & Normalization for Medical Imaging**
   - **Objective**: Perform image segmentation and normalization on medical images (e.g., MRI scans) to enhance their quality for further analysis.
   - **Techniques Used**: Image segmentation, normalization, data augmentation.
   - **Why It‚Äôs Important**: Segmentation and normalization are essential preprocessing steps in medical image analysis, allowing us to focus on the most relevant features of the data.
   - **Code Reference**: `Image-Segmentation-Normalization-Medical-Imaging.py` demonstrates the segmentation and normalization process.

### 2. **MRI Data Sub-Volume Extraction**
   - **Objective**: Extract sub-volumes from large MRI images for more efficient processing and analysis.
   - **Techniques Used**: Data preprocessing, sub-volume extraction.
   - **Why It‚Äôs Important**: Extracting smaller sections from large MRI scans allows for faster computation and helps handle data more effectively.
   - **Code Reference**: See `MRI-Data-Sub-Section.py` for a demonstration of sub-volume extraction.

### 3. **Exploring MRI Data üîç**
   - **Objective**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on MRI data to gain insights before building models.
   - **Techniques Used**: Data visualization, statistical analysis.
   - **Why It‚Äôs Important**: EDA helps understand the dataset, identify any potential issues, and makes model development more informed and efficient.
   - **Code Reference**: `explore_mri_data.py` includes methods for data visualization and statistical analysis of MRI datasets.

### 4. **ROC Curve Analysis for Model Evaluation üìä**
   - **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of models using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and calculate the AUC (Area Under the Curve).
   - **Techniques Used**: Model evaluation, classification metrics, AUC.
   - **Why It‚Äôs Important**: The ROC curve is a powerful tool for evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning models, especially in medical diagnostics.
   - **Code Reference**: `roc_curve_analysis.py` shows how to compute and visualize ROC curves for model evaluation.

### 5. **U-Net for Image Segmentation**
   - **Objective**: Use **U-Net**, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, to segment medical images like MRI scans.
   - **Techniques Used**: U-Net, deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
   - **Why It‚Äôs Important**: U-Net is widely used in medical imaging due to its effectiveness in precise image segmentation tasks.
   - **Code Reference**: `unet_model.py` illustrates how to train and implement a U-Net model for MRI scan segmentation.
